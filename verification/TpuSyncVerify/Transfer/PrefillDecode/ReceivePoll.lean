# Receive session: what the poll-side readiness check contributes

An audit of `IsReadyToComplete` (`.cc:430-436`) and of the manager's poll
that acts on it (`mgr.cc:966-970`), on the receive model of `Receive.lean`.
Citations and abbreviations are as there (tpu-sync `50b0774`, re-pinned from
`01ffa3d` on 2026-10-06).

`TransferReceiveSession` has two ways to finish successfully:

* the H2D callback that completes the last layer calls `FinishLocked()`
  (`.cc:662-669`) and records the end-of-transfer metrics (`.cc:683-693`);
* the manager's poll calls `Finish()` when `IsReadyToComplete()` holds, i.e.
  `(network_completed_ || num_completed_layers_ == total_layers) &&
  AllH2dDoneLocked()`.

`TransferSendSession` has only the first. The proposal under review removes
the second (and with it `h2d_futures_`, `network_completed_` and the dead
`if (all_complete)` finish in `OnBlocksReceived`, `.cc:560-575`). This module
asks what the second way does today, and what changes without it.

## Results

On every reachable state of the shipping model:

* `CallbackFinishes` (`reachable_callbackFinishes`): with at least one layer,
  `num_completed_layers_ == num_layers()` already implies `draining_` — the
  callback that completed the last layer finished the session — and an error
  status implies `draining_`.
* `pollReady_window`: with at least one layer the poll can only fire through
  `network_completed_`, in the window after every copy's future is ready and
  before the last callback has bumped `num_completed_layers_`. The other
  disjunct of `IsReadyToComplete` is dead code there.
* `netAccount_frame`: `OnBlocksReceived` never finishes the session; when its
  `all_complete` test could pass the session is already draining and the
  handler has returned early (`.cc:541-543`).
* `pollReady_no_settle`: firing in that window never settles the session — a
  callback is still in flight, so `done_` and publication wait for it exactly
  as they would without the poll. The poll moves the start of draining
  earlier; it does not move settlement or the published outcome.

What the earlier draining changes is the last callback's bookkeeping: it
finds `draining_` set and skips `RecordTransferDuration`, `RecordH2dComplete`
and `RecordEnd`. `RecvM` adds a ghost bit `metrics` for those calls and
`stepM poll` runs the model with (`poll = true`, the shipping code) or without
(`poll = false`, the proposal) the poll:

* with the poll, `published = some true ∧ metrics = false` is reachable
  (`trace_poll_skips_metrics`; the bounded search finds it too);
* without it, `published = some true → metrics = true` is an invariant
  (`noPoll_metrics_on_success`), every property of `Receive.lean` still
  holds (`noPoll_safe`), every reachable state can still settle and release
  its staging (`noPoll_can_settle`), and the normal completion is unchanged
  (`trace_noPoll_normal`).

The one case where the poll is load-bearing is `num_layers() == 0`: nothing
else ever calls `FinishLocked()` (`noPoll_zero_layers_never_succeeds`),
whereas with the poll the session is complete at once
(`trace_zero_layers_poll`). A change that drops the poll has to finish a
zero-layer receive at creation, as `TransferSendSession::StartPush` does for
a zero-layer send (`send.cc:302-305`).
